\section{Example Math}

\subsection{Simple equation with a number}

I can reference this equation \ref{eqn:sample-dmath} by adding a unique label.

\begin{dmath}
\frac{V_{in}-V_x}{R_1}- \frac{V_x}{Z_1} + \frac{V_x - V_o}{Z_1} = 0
\label{eqn:sample-dmath}
\end{dmath}

\subsection{A dmath group with no align}
\begin{dgroup}[noalign]
\begin{dmath}
\frac{V_{in}-V_x}{R_1}- \frac{V_x}{Z_1} + \frac{V_x - V_o}{Z_1} = 0
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}
\frac{V_{in}}{R_1} = -\frac{V_o}{R2} - \frac{V_o Z_1}{R_2 Z_1} - \frac{V_o}{Z_1}- \frac{Z_1 V_o}{R_1 R_2}
\end{dmath}
\label{eqn:sample-dgroup-noalign}
\end{dgroup}

\subsection{A dmath group with align on}

\begin{dgroup}
\begin{dmath}
\frac{V_{in}-V_x}{R_1}- \frac{V_x}{Z_1} + \frac{V_x - V_o}{Z_1} = 0
\end{dmath}
\begin{dmath}
\frac{V_{in}}{R_1} = -\frac{V_o}{R2} - \frac{V_o Z_1}{R_2 Z_1} - \frac{V_o}{Z_1}- \frac{Z_1 V_o}{R_1 R_2}
\end{dmath}
\label{eqn:sample-dgroup}
\end{dgroup}

\subsection{In-line Math}
Sample with math included in-line with text along with units. $f_0$ at 620 \si{\hertz}.

\subsection{Symbols}

\begin{dmath}
\frac{4.3 \si{\volt}}{1 \si{\kilo\ohm}} = 4.3 \si{\milli\ampere}
\end{dmath}

\subsection{Math With Normal Text}

\begin{dmath}
\text{Average rate of speech} = \frac{\text{Words spoken}}{\text{Number of Seconds}}
\label{eqn:sample-math-with-regular-text}
\end{dmath}
