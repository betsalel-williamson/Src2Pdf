\section{Example Figures}

\subsection{Plain Figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{example-image}
  \caption{Sample image with width specified.}
  \label{fig:sample-figure}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics{example-image}
  \caption{Sample image with width not specified}
  \label{fig:sample-figure-2}
\end{figure}

% \begin{figure*} is a figure that spans both columns.
\subsection{Referencing Figures}

Example from \href{link}{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/278727/split-subfigures-over-multiple-pages}. I can reference Figs. \ref{fig:sample-sub-figs} on pages \pageref{fig:sample-sub-figs} and \pageref{fig:sample-sub-fig-continued} because they have a label at the end. The label must be listed after the caption.

\subsection{Figure with Sub-Figures}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
      \subfloat[k near 0]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}} 
  \subfloat[k = 50]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}} % blank line to have next subfloats on next line

  \subfloat[k = 190]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}}
  \subfloat[k = 1e12]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}}

    \caption{$Q^{*}$ values for different arms}
    \label{fig:sample-sub-figs}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]\ContinuedFloat
    \centering
      \subfloat[k near 0]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}} 
  \subfloat[k = 50]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}} % blank line to have next subfloats on next line
  
  \subfloat[k = 190]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}}
  \subfloat[k = 1e12]{\includegraphics[width = 3in]{example-image}}
   
    \caption{Continued. Figure not in-line with text.}
    \label{fig:sample-sub-fig-continued}
\end{figure}
